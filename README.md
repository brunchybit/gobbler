# gobbler
Go SQL library inspired by [yesql](https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql).  Our current thinking is that we will utilize go generate to build functions based on a directory of .sql files.  This should provide a strongly typed interface to use for querying purposes while at the same time allowing you the simplicity of writing pure sql.
